               ARM Microcontroller Firmware Development Framework

   Here is a framework for developing firmware for a number of [1]ARM
   (Advanced RISC Machine) architecture single chip microcontrollers.

   Each MCU directory includes startup code, linker script, [2]newlib
   syscall bindings, and [3]OpenOCD scripts for debugging and flashing.

News

     * 5 January 2015 -- Upgraded binutils to 2.25, gcc to 4.9.2, newlib
       to 2.2.0, and gdb to 7.8.1. With newlib 2.2.0, the INTEGER_STDIO
       and CONIO_STDIO options are no longer needed. CONIO_STDIO is still
       supported, mostly for other tool chains such as [4]GNU ARM
       Embedded. It is enabled by adding WITH_CONIO=yes to the make
       command line options.
     * 21 January 2015 -- Upgraded gdb to 7.8.2. Build gcc prequisites,
       including libiconv, from source. Added auxiliary makefile for
       building a Canadian Cross ARM microcontroller toolchain for the
       Raspberry Pi.
     * 13 April 2015 -- Renamed NETDUINO2 (which is STM32F2) to
       NETDUNIOPLUS2 (which is STM32F4). Added support for programming
       STM32 flash with [5]dfu-util.
     * 27 April 2015 -- Upgraded the STM32F4 Standard Peripheral Library
       to version 1.5.0. Added support for the [6]NUCLEO-F411RE board, and
       the corresponding STM32F411RE MCU.
     * 6 May 2015 -- Fixed a subtle bug in the linker scripts: (.data)
       should be (.data*) and (.bss) should be (.bss*). This was
       preventing successful use of the [7]GNU ARM Embedded toolchain,
       because some data sections were being discarded.
     * 7 May 2015 -- Define BOARDNAME C preprocessor macro. Eliminated the
       WITH_LIBSTDCPP make macro; always link with libstdc++. Added a C++
       iostream library test. The C++ iostream library now works, but adds
       over 200 kilobytes of code and will not fit in many of the smaller
       ARM microcontrollers. C++ container classes may or may not fit.
       Added system tick timer services, including millisleep() and
       sleep().
     * 8 May 2015 -- Fixed a bug in device_write(). Added code to device.c
       to honor O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY flags. Moved I/O syscall definitions
       from syscalls.c to device.c, where they are aliased to
       device_xxxx() functions. This eliminates an unnecessary function
       call for each syscall operation.
     * 12 May 2015 -- More improvements in device.c: Eliminated some calls
       to memset(). Switched to [8]texane/stlink even for Windows.
       Implemented interrupt driven serial I/O for the STM32F4 family.
     * 13 May 2015 -- Added even more error checking to device.c. Made the
       device table private to device.c. Added general support for
       fcntl(). The F_GETFL and F_SETFL operations are available for any
       file descriptor while other operations are delegated to the device
       specific fcntl() handler, if one was provided when the device was
       registered.
     * 25 May 2015 -- Stopped using the STM32F4 Standard Peripheral
       Library. Use [9]CMSIS instead. Eliminated USB serial port console
       support from most targets. It was just too unstable and hard to
       maintain. It is so much easier to use dedicated a dedicated USB
       serial port device like the [10]FT232R. Changed STM32F4 makefiles
       to always use the hardware FPU. With recent versions of newlib,
       there is no longer a code size penalty from enabling the FPU.
     * 10 June 2015 -- Another massive overhaul: Added support for the
       [11]STM32 M4 Clicker board. Dropped support for the [12]STM32 Value
       Line Discovery board. (Its ST-Link/V1 is obsolete.) Dropped support
       for the obsolete AT91SAM7S, LPC23xx, and STR91x MCU families.
       Dropped support for the obsolete [13]Wiznet W5200. Dropped support
       for the [14]BlueBoard LPC1768. Upgraded FreeRTOS to V8.2.1.
       Implemented interrupt driven serial I/O for the STM32F1 MCU family.
       Upgraded OpenOCD to 0.9.0. Added support for the [15]NUCLEO-F103RB
       board. Use a common LED test for all targets. Implemented A/D
       services for the STM32F4 MCU family. Use a common A/D test for all
       targets. Added button (momentary switch) services. Stopped using
       the STM32F1 Standard Peripheral Library. Use [16]CMSIS instead.
       Added code to each of the assembly language startup files to call
       _exit() if main() returns.
