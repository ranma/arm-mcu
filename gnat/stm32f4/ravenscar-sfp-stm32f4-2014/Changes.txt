Changes to the Adacore Libre GNAT/GPL Ravenscar profile RTS for STM32F4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

$Id$

1. Imported Ravenscar profile RTS source files from AdaCore Libre
   GNAT 2014 for STM32F4.

2. Changed the console serial port from USART1 to USART2 on pins
   PA2 and PA3, for compatibility with my C language framework.
   Added definitions for GPIOA, GPIOC-I, and USART2 to s_stm32f.ads.

3. Renamed setup_pll.adb to setup_pll.adb.original and s-bbpara.ads
   to s-bbpara.ads.original.  Added setup_pll.adb.$(BOARDNAME) and
   s_bbpara.ads.$(BOARDNAME), because these files contain board
   specific clock configuration information.  The Makefile will now
   select the proper files for each board at library compilation time.

4. Removed unneeded ada_object_path and ada_source_path.

5. Removed unneeded start-ram.S and stm32f4-ram.ld.
