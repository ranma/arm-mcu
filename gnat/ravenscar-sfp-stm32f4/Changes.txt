Changes to the Adacore Libre GNAT/GPL Ravenscar profile for STM32F4
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Imported Ravenscar profile RTS source files from AdaCore Libre
   GNAT 2014 for STM32F4.

2. Changed the console serial port from USART1 to USART2 on pins
   PA2 and PA3, for compatibility with my C language framework.
   Added definitions for GPIOA, GPIOC-I, and USART2 to s_stm32f.ads.
