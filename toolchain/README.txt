                      ARM Microcontroller Toolchain Notes

   This toolchain includes binutils, gcc, newlib, and gdb. It may be built
   for Linux, OpenBSD, and Windows (using Cygwin). The Linux, OpenBSD, and
   Windows releases are virtually identical in every respect. (This is the
   reason I created my own toolchain: I routinely flip back and forth
   among Linux, OpenBSD, and Windows development environments.)

   My toolchain builds multilibs for the various Cortex-Mx devices,
   including hardware floating point for the Cortex-M4.
